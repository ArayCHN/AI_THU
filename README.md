# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

The assignments of this course partly come from the Berkeley AI project. Assignment 1 and 2 can be found directly on **ai.berkeley.edu** Programs are rewritten in a way such that students can not directly use the source code of this repo or they will **Fail** *autograder.py*.

Homework 3 was basically designed by TA of this course. Topics like KNN, Perceptron, Pricipal Component Analysis etc. are covered.

## Some Notes
In order to prevent potential plagarism by future students of this course, hidden pitfalls are implanted in the code. All codes can NOT be directly used. 

Correct algorithms are instead described in these three files:

* /hw1/*report.pdf*
* /hw2/*report.pdf*
* /hw3/*report.pdf*

Also, the *.tex* files of these three reports are provided, for quick reference.

Please refer to them instead.
